# About Us

Pleasant Home Community Church was first established in 1897. It has a long history of biblical faithfulness which has continued today through the expository preaching 
of Godâ€™s Word.

If you visit one of our services, you will notice that we like to keep things simple. We worship our Savior, study His Word, and enjoy sweet fellowship with one another. 
We are not about flashy church growth strategies or entertaining our members. We are about knowing God, making Him known, and enjoying the common salvation we have with 
the saints of Christ. If you are looking for a church that holds to the inerrancy, infallibility, and sufficiency of Scripture, we invite you to come and worship with us.
